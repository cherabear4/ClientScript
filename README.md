# ClientScript
https://docs-clientscript.netlify.app

# Get Started
download the transpile executable from the releases tab. Simply run it and input a file, not need to add the file suffix just add the name of the file.
 * Main.cl
    Transpile: Main
    
The output will be a Main.java!

# How to use it
Client script is relatively simple that being said to implement quick methods all you have to do is write some java code, there are currently 6 different
qucik methods -- @mc, @log, @drwscrn, @ing, @ap, @kt.

# @mc

@mc is a short way of writing the minecraft mouseClicked() method

Example:
@mc{
//some code
}

# @log

@log is a short way of writing the java System.out.println() method

Example:
@log("some text");

# @drwscrn

@drwscrn is a short way of writing the minecraft drawScreen() method

Example:
@drwscrn{
//some code
}

# @mc

@ing is a short way of writing the minecraft initGui() method

Example:
@ing{
//some code
}

# @ap

@ap is a short way of writing the minecraft actionPerformed() method

Example:
@ap{
//some code
}

# @mc

@mc is a short way of writing the minecraft keyTyped() method

Example:
@kt{
//some code
}
# End
I will be adding more to this little project in the meantime have fun.
